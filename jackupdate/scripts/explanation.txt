here's how this stuff works:
the game manager script can be applied to an empty game object; it doesn't need
any tags, colliders, anything. what the script does need is a reference to the
player, so just drag the player capsule into the appropriate field. the script
has a scenes array, and in the function loadSceneArray, you will have to 
hardcode the names of each scene into the array. two important things to note
here: the scenes that you load into the array must be loaded into the build 
settings (do this with File->Build Settings then click Add Open Scenes), AND
the order of scenes in the array must match the order of scenes in the build
settings EXACTLY.
in dropbox, i have uploaded an asset package to import called
gamaManagerUpdate. this package has the prefabs and scripts you will need to
create levels with the game manager. it's unclear to me at this time weather or
not scenes can be shared as prefabs, we'll see if that works i suppose.
to actually trigger scene changes, there are two important game objects that
need to be created. i implemented death/respawn as a large plane (100 x 100)
located at -40 y below the lowest point in your scene. this plane needs 
the tag "Respawn." you'll probably want to turn off the mesh renderer so the 
plane is invisible, but be careful not to also turn off the mesh collider,
else the respawn function won't work. to transition between scenes, make an
game object with any collider and tag is as "Continue" (this tag isn't default,
so make your own if you have to). when the player collides with an object 
tagged "Continue," the next scene in the list will be loaded.
